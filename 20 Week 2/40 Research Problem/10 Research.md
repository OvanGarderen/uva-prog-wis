# Prime sieve

This is an optional research problem. It will not gain you any credit, but it will allow you to deepen your experience with Python and algorithms.

A *prime sieve* is a way to generate prime numbers by efficiently eliminating non-primes. It can be implemented in a programming language, and the efficiency of the algorithm is quite dependent on the *way* of implementing it.

Try to implement a prime sieve that generates the first 1000 primes. When working, try to optimize it to be more efficient (in time, or in memory usage). It is important that you try to get something simple working first, so you gain understanding of the problem.

You will need to do your own research on choosing an appropriate algorithm and implementation strategy. Note that it might be needed to use a *list* for a first try at the algorithm.

This problem is a lot less interesting if you re-use existing Python code! If you get in trouble, ask questions and don't give up!
