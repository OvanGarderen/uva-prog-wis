Introduction to programming for Mathematics
===========================================

This is the mini-course in programming for first year mathematics students at
the University of Amsterdam. It is a fast paced course that is designed to be
combined with lots of assisted programming hours.

The course is mostly based on MIT's 6.189 and 6.00, both of which are available
at http://ocw.mit.edu/.
